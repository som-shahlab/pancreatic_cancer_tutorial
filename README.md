# pancreatic_cancer

This codebase illustrates how to use CLMBR and MOTOR on real data for one-year risk predections for pancreatic cancer.

Run the following scripts in order:

1. create_labels.py
2. create_features.py
3. train_baselines.py
4. train_motor.py
5. train_clmbr.py

The notebook analyze_results.ipynb allows you to analyze the results of that analysis.
